## REST APIs for Datastore management on HyperFlex 4.0+ cluster.
HX APIs do need an token to authenticate. The following steps will guide you through a process which will get the HX Token en Cluster UUID, which is needed for the Datastores.

#### STEP1: 
Start with filling in the HX IP address in the Variables HXCIP

#### STEP3 to get the Cluster UUID.
Open STEP3: Get HX Cluster UUID and hit **SEND**.
This Cluster UUID will be copied into the Collection variable **CUUID**.

#####Now you can play with the Datastore collection.  
You can use the order of the DS numbering and this is not a requirement.

When you create a Datastore, the Datastore UUID is saved in the variable **dsuuid**.  
The Edit Datastore and Delete datastore are using these variables.
